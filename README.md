## Blackjack and Solitaire/Patience/Klondike in c++ console

### Controls

- These games are controlled entirely with the keyboard
- Use the regular (not numpad) arrow keys to move the menu cursor
- Use the enter key to select the currently highlighted option

### Notes

- The "exe" folder should contain a pre-compiled windows version of the game
- The game runs explicitly at 720x1280p and if you change the window size it will change itself back
- - Doing this will also cause visual artifacts in some areas of the screen
